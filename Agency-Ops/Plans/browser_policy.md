# Browser Usage Policy

> [!CAUTION]
> **Strict Compliance Required**: These rules govern all browser tool usage for this project.

## Core Restrictions
1.  **No Screenshots**: The agent is strictly forbidden from taking screenshots or recording the browser. All visual validation must be done via code analysis and local previews.
2.  **No Monitoring**: The agent must not remain active in the browser or "watch" the user's sessions.
3.  **Account Lock**: Strictly use ONLY the **"Person 1"** Google Chrome profile for any necessary browser actions. Do NOT use the default or any other profile.

## Workflow Alignment
- **Code-First Standard**: The standard of work must remain high without relying on visual feedback from the browser tool.
- **Local Verification**: Rely on local file inspection and standard terminal outputs to verify successful implementations.
