## 🚀 Key Patterns & Macro-Trends

### 1. Visual Presentation of "Work"
Agencies are moving away from flat screenshots. The dominant trends for presenting emails are:
*   **The "Modular Explode":** Showing an email broken into its component modules (headline, product grid, footer) often floating in 3D space.
*   **Device-in-Situ:** High-res mockups of an iPhone 16 being held, with the email scrolling or animated.
*   **The "Long Scroll" Shadow:** One very long email mockup with a subtle drop shadow, often placed at an angle.
*   **Animated GIF Previews:** Showing the "dynamic" parts of the email (hover states, scrolling interaction) on the homepage.
*   **Case Study Overlays:** Clicking a "View Design" button that opens a full-screen, high-res scrollable view of the email next to the results it generated.

### 2. Positioning Shifts
*   **From "Email Agency" to "Retention Ecosystem":** Almost no one labels themselves as just "Email." They use "Retention Marketing," "Lifecycle Automation," or "Owned Channel Growth."
*   **Seniority as a Feature:** Boutique agencies (like Quimby) explicitly call out "No Junior Account Managers" to differentiate from "Agency Factories" like Common Thread or MuteSix.
*   **Data vs. Magic:** There is a split between **Data-Obsessed** (Chronos, Common Thread) and **Creatively-Driven** (&BAM, Flowium). The most successful hybridized these (Fuel Made).

## 💡 Strategic Takeaways for Your Website

1.  **Lead with the "Beauty" Niche:** Since many top agencies are generalist ecom, your specific focus on Beauty is a huge differentiator. Use "Beauty-Grade Retention" terminology.
2.  **Show, Don't Just Tell:** Use a **Carousel of high-res mobile mockups** for your email examples. Make them look "shippable."
3.  **Name Your Framework:** Instead of saying "I do flows," call it something like "The Radiance Retention System" or "The Beauty Lifecycle Loop."
4.  **Emphasize "Founder-Led":** If you are an agency of one or a small team, position against the "Agency Mills" by highlighting that the strategy comes from you, not an intern.
5.  **Data + Aesthetic:** Beauty brands are terrified of "ugly" performance emails. Your value prop should be: *"High-performance data that looks like a luxury magazine."*
