# Skill: Email Performance Ledger (Lifecycle Intelligence)

> **Purpose:** To log the exact "DNA" of every email campaign and automated flow to identify what drives revenue through the lens of Brand Economics.

## The Ledger Entry Framework
Every time an email is logged, use the following structure:

## Visual & Note Intake (Your Workflow)
To log an email, simply:
1. **Upload a screenshot** of the email layout.
2. **Paste your raw notes** (e.g., "sent this on payday, used the founder angle because of the recent price hike, felt a bit long").

**My Role:** I will analyze the visual layout (colors, image hierarchy, CTA placement) and synthesize your notes into the structured format below. **I will act as your project librarian—recording the notes so you don't have to manually fill out the spreadsheet.**

### 1. Metadata
... [Metadata Fields] ...

### 4. Visual Analysis (AI Generated from Image)
- **Hierarchy:** (Where does the eye go first?)
- **Color Palette:** (Soft/Premium vs Vibrant/Urgent)
- **Image Density:** (Text-to-image ratio)
- **Mobile vs Desktop check:** (If multiple screenshots provided)

### 5. Strategy Notes (Synthesized from User Input)
- **Direct Voice:** [Your specific observations about why this was sent]
- **Economic Context:** [How this fits into current market conditions for the brand]

### 6. Results (To be updated)
- **Open Rate:** [%] | **Click Rate:** [%] | **RPR:** [$]

## Analysis Mode: Internal Optimization
When asked to "Audit [Brand Name]'s Performance," prioritize identifying internal winning patterns:

1. **Creative Sensitivity:** Do people-led images significantly outperform product-only shots for this specific audience?
2. **Offer Anchor Point:** Does moving the discount from the Header to the Footer (or P.S.) affect conversion vs click-through?
3. **Founder vs Brand:** Do 'Founder Emails' or 'Behind the Scenes' content drive higher engagement or long-term LTV compared to standard promos?
4. **Payday Economics:** Do price-reference and heavy-discount emails see a disproportionate lift during payday windows (1st/15th/end of month)?
5. **Format Fit:** Does plain text atau minimal design work better for 'Educational' content versus 'Ingredient' content?
6. **Social Proof Lift:** Quantify the actual RPR difference in emails with vs. without testimonials.

## Cross-Brand Layer (Secondary)
Once internal winner are found, compare against the "Masstige vs Luxury" framework to see if the brand's performance matches its category gravity or if it's an outlier.

## Interaction Instructions
- If the user provides a Klaviyo name and date, prompt them for the "Angle" and "Copy Style" to ensure the ledger stays high-quality.
- Use this ledger to inform the `email_copywriting_skill.md` for future campaigns.
