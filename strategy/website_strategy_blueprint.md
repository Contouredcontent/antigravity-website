# Agency Website Level-Up: Strategic Blueprint

Based on the competitive research of the top 20 agencies, this plan outlines the "perfect setup" for your agency's website refinement.

## 🏗 Project Infrastructure (The Setup)
To keep this project organized, I recommend the following folder structure in your workspace:
```text
/agency-website/
├── /strategy/          # Research, brand guidelines, messaging docs
├── /content/           # Copy drafts for all pages
├── /design/            # Mockups, assets, images
├── /implementation/    # Actual HTML/CSS/JS code
└── /reference/         # Competitive screenshots/inspiration
```

## 🎯 Positioning Strategy: "Scientific Luxury Retention"
We are positioning the agency as the bridge between **High-End Beauty Aesthetics** and **Scientific Economic Decoding**.
- **The Core Promise:** Email & SMS that converts by decoding the psychology of the modern beauty consumer.
- **The Specialized Angle:** "Built for Beauty. Backed by Strategy."

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Aesthetic Foundation**:
> - **Universal Base**: The entire site uses the light pink/white base from the Hero (No dark-background sections).
> - **Atmosphere**: Maintains the subtle **HQ Cloud & Star Overlay** (`assets/pink-cloud-soft.jpg` at 0.08 opacity) and white 'flares' for depth.
> - **Accents**: Tyrian Purple is used surgically as an accent color (buttons, stats, highlights), not for section backgrounds.
> - **Copy Note**: Placeholder copy first, refined "Scientific" copy later.

## 🗺 Website Architecture (The Flow)

1.  **The Hero (Current)**: Keep existing hero as is (Light base + Cloud overlay).
2.  **The Proof Bar**: A sliding bar across the screen featuring client names/logos.
    - **Hover Effect**: Names highlight in the Tyrian Purple hero color.
3.  **The Anchor (Phone Flip)**: An animated phone flipping from Left-Center to Right, cycling through email visuals.
    - **Content**: Basic explainer of Decode, Design, Deliver + Economic Analysis insights + CTA.
4.  **The Results (Stats)**: 2 high-impact stats achieved for brands.
    - **Visual**: Stat cards paired with a "Case Study →" button.
5.  **The Offer (Services)**: Services overview based on provided high-end examples.
    - **Visual**: Compact grid layout with a "light up" hover effect.
6.  **The Believers (Testimonials)**: Client social proof with arrow navigation to move between slides.
7.  **The Deep Dive (Services In-Depth)**: Opal-style layout for services (Staircase content flow).
    - **Visual**: "Pre-purchase flows" listed, followed by email visuals positioned below (not to the side).
8.  **The Framework (BBB/DDD)**: Horizontal layout version of the Decode → Design → Deliver framework.
    - **Color Palette**: Strictly Light Pink/White/Tyrian Purple (Flipping any dark-mode source examples).
9.  **The Portfolio (Case Studies)**: Case study highlights with a "classier/editorial" image style.
10. **The Knowledge (FAQ)**: Accordion-style "Questions already answered" section.
11. **The Closer (CTA + Scroll)**: Final CTA section with a marquee of emails scrolling Left to Right at the bottom.

## 📅 Proposed Roadmap

### Phase 1: Messaging & Wireframing (Current)

## 🛠 Next Steps
1.  **Do you want me to create the folder structure listed above?**
2.  **Should we start drafting the Homepage copy based on "The Radiance Lifecycle Loop" (or a name you prefer)?**
